# Wikipedia Search Tool

index.html opens a responsive webpage that displays a search box and a Random Article button. Using
these tools, you can perform a search of Wikipedia, or use the random article button to get a random
Wikipedia article. Random articles will open in-page in an iframe, bumping the search bar to the top.
links from search results will open in new tabs.

## Getting Started

All you need to do is download the entire repo and open index.html to open the webpage in your
default web browser.
